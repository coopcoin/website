        Factoring offers an attractive growth potential and essential positive socio-economic impact due to its relatively small market share worldwide and until now prohibitively high costs.

        The Factoring Asset-Based-Token (ABT100) will allow companies to benefit from factoring through secure, economical and transparent processes.
    process:
      headline: The process of an ABT100 (simplified)

        step1: 'Partner creates factoring contract & sends requests CoopCoin to mint a corresponding ABT100'
        step2: 'Concensus on contract mints ABT100 & assigns ownership'
        step3: 'Owner can sell or use ABT100 on secondary market (e.g. as collateral)'
        step4: 'CoopCoin signals ABT100 as ready to be liquidated & verifies ownership'
        step5: 'Partner pays owner & obtains cryptographic proof of destruction of ABT100'
